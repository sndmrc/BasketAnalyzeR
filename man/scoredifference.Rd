\title{Computes the score difference between the two teams in the match}
\usage{
scoredifference(PbP_data, team_name, player_data, team_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{PbP_data}{a play-by-play data frame, previously handled by \code{PbPmanipulation}}

\item{team_name}{name of the team we are interested in. The name can be either shortened (e.g. CLE) or extended (e.g. Cleveland Cavaliers)}

\item{player_data}{dataframe containing the boxscore of the whole season for all teams. We only need it to know the players who have played at least one match for every team during the season. The default one is the Pbox dataframe contained in the BasketballAnalyzeR package, which features data regarding the 2017-18 season. This dataframe might be substituted by a dataframe which has a column \code{Player} containing in each row the name of the players and a second columd \code{Team} containing the extended name (e.g. Golden State Warriors) of the team in which the player has played at least one match. If a player has played at least one match for more than one team during the same season, he/she will have a row for each franchise where has played}

\item{team_data}{dataframe, contains several data regarding the teams in the NBA. Inside this function it is used only to check if \code{team_name} corresponds to a team in the NBA. It doesn't have to be changed if the teams in the play-by-play considered are the same as in the 2017-18 season}
}
\value{
the initial play-by-play dataframe, with two additional columns:

\itemize{
\item \code{score.diff}: difference between the score of \code{team_name} and the score of the opposite team (see \code{details} for more informations)
}

*\code{isHome}: boolean which indicates if \code{team_name} is the home team in that play-by-play row
}
\description{
Computes the score difference between the two teams in the match
}
\details{
The score difference computed by the function can be different from the simple difference between the score of the home team and the one of the away team, as we have to take account of the points scored during an action. Indeed, the value of \code{score.diff} indicates the difference in the score while the action was played
}
\examples{
PbP <- PbPmanipulation(PbP.BDB)
PbP <- scoredifference(PbP, team_name="GSW", player_data=Pbox, team_data=Tadd)
